<p class="Pp">The <i>Heirloom Toolchest</i> is a collection of standard Unix
    utilities that is intended to provide maximum compatibility with traditional
    Unix while incorporating additional features necessary today. To achieve
    this, utilities are derived from original Unix sources if permitted by its
    licenses. This means that material from Unix 6th Edition, Unix 7th Edition,
    and Unix 32V was used, since these systems were put under an Open Source
    license by Caldera in January 2002. In addition, 4BSD source (governed by
    the University's copyright and partially derived from 32V) has been used.
    (Other sources were Sun's `OpenSolaris', Caldera's `Open Source Unix[tm]
    Tools', the MINIX utility collection, Plan 9, and Info-ZIP's compression
    codes.) If no freely available Unix sources were available (for example, for
    tools introduced in System III or System V), utilities were rewritten from
    scratch. (The exact license terms are provided in a separate document.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The tools in this collection are oriented on the specifications or
    systems named below. Since there are some incompatibilities between them,
    some tools are present in more than one version.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2013;</dt>
  <dd>System V Interface Definition, Third Edition (UNIX System Laboratories,
      1992) (SVID3). This specification corresponds to a System V Release 4 or
      Solaris 2 system. Utilities in <b>/usr/5bin</b> are modeled after this
      specification and related system environments. If extensions introduced in
      POSIX.2 or POSIX.1-2001 (see below) did not provoke conflicts with the
      behavior at this level, they were incorporated in these utilities as well.
      This is the most traditional personality available with the <i>Heirloom
      Toolchest</i>; prominently, regular expressions do not have any of the
      internationalization features (see <i>ed</i>(1) and <i>egrep</i>(1)), and
      <i>awk</i> is the old version, <i>oawk</i>(1). Use this personality to get
      best compatibility with traditional System V behavior.</dd>
  <dt>&#x2013;</dt>
  <dd>System V Interface Definition, Fourth Edition (Novell, Inc., 1995)
      (SVID4). This specification corresponds to a System V Release 4.2 MP
      system. Utilities in <b>/usr/5bin/s42</b> are modeled after this
      specification and related system environments. If extensions introduced in
      POSIX.2 or POSIX.1-2001 (see below) did not provoke conflicts with the
      behavior at this level, they were incorporated in these utilities as well.
      The most essential difference between this and the SVID3 personality are
      internationalized regular expressions and the choice of the new awk,
      <i>nawk</i>(1), for <i>awk</i>. Use this personality to get traditional
      System V behavior combined with internationalized regular
    expressions.</dd>
  <dt>&#x2013;</dt>
  <dd>ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993 / ANSI/IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (POSIX.2), with the
      extensions of The Single UNIX Specification, Version 2 (The Open Group,
      1997). Utilities in <b>/usr/5bin/posix</b> are intended to fully comply to
      this specification even in cases of conflict with historical behavior.
      Non-conflicting extensions to POSIX.2 found in the environments described
      above are also present in these utilities. Use this personality if you
      need POSIX.2 features in preference to traditional System V ones.</dd>
  <dt>&#x2013;</dt>
  <dd>ISO/IEC 9945-1:2001 / ANSI/IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (POSIX.1-2001), with the
      extensions of The Single UNIX Specification, Version 3 (The Open Group,
      2001). Utilities in <b>/usr/5bin/posix2001</b> are intended to fully
      comply to this specification even in cases of conflict with historical
      behavior. Non-conflicting extensions to POSIX.1-2001 found in the
      environments described above are also present in these utilities. Use this
      personality if you need POSIX.1-2001 features in preference to traditional
      System V ones.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">To use the <i>Heirloom Toolchest</i>, select one of these
    personalities and put the corresponding directory at the beginning of the
    PATH environment variable, immediately followed by the toolchest base
    directory, <b>/usr/5bin</b> (which contains the tools that are the same for
    all personalities). For example, to use the toolchest with a SVID4
    personality, execute</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">PATH=/usr/5bin/s42:/usr/5bin:$PATH export PATH</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">You must select exactly one of the personalities above; you do not
    have access to the complete set of tools otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">The manual pages generally note which behavior corresponds to
    which utility version. They also mark whether options and arguments were
    part of System V, were introduced with POSIX.2 or POSIX.1-2001, or if they
    are extensions provided by the Heirloom Toolchest, (possibly oriented at
    extensions introduced by other vendors). Such extensions are subject to
    change without a grace period; they are only intended for interactive usage
    and should not be included in scripts.</p>
<p class="Pp">The toolchest also includes some utilities modeled after the BSD
    Compatibility environment of System V; these roughly correspond to 4.3BSD or
    SunOS 4 systems. These tools can be found in <b>/usr/ucb</b>; since they do
    not form a full personality set as the ones described above, they should be
    used in addition, as e.g.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">PATH=/usr/ucb:/usr/5bin/s42:/usr/5bin:$PATH export PATH</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
does.
<p class="Pp">While the <i>Heirloom Toolchest</i> is intended to be as
    compatible as possible with historical practice in general, annoying static
    limits of historical implementations are not present any longer. Input lines
    of unlimited length are generally accepted (as long as enough memory is
    available); most utilities are also able to handle binary input data (i.e.
    ASCII NUL characters in the input stream).</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Multibyte_character_encodings"><a class="permalink" href="#Multibyte_character_encodings">Multibyte
  character encodings</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <i>Heirloom Toolchest</i> includes support for multibyte
    character encodings; if the underlying C library supports this and the
    <i>LC_CTYPE</i> locale (see <i>locale</i>(7) for an introduction) is set
    appropriately, multiple input bytes can form a single character and are
    handled as such in regular expressions, display width computations etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">Multibyte character support was designed with special regard to
    the UTF-8 encoding. Additional supported encodings are EUC-JP, EUC-KR, Big5,
    Big5-HKSCS, GB&#x00A0;2312, and GBK. Other encodings may also work, with the
    following restrictions:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2013;</dt>
  <dd>The character set must be a superset of ASCII (more specifically, of the
      International Reference Version of ISO&#x00A0;646). All ASCII characters
      must be encoded as a single byte with the same value as the ASCII
      character. This excludes 7-bit encodings like UTF-7. In addition, the C
      language implementation must map each ASCII character to a wide character
      with the same value.</dd>
  <dt>&#x2013;</dt>
  <dd>The first byte of each multibyte character must have the highest bit set,
      i.e. it must not be an ASCII character. This excludes encodings whose
      sequences start with ASCII characters like TCVN 5712.</dd>
  <dt>&#x2013;</dt>
  <dd>Locking-shift encodings, like those that use ISO&#x00A0;2022 escape
      sequences, are not supported.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Character comparison, regular expression matching and similar
    tasks are generally performed on the character representation obtained from
    the locale processing of the C library. A glyph formed by the application of
    combining characters to a base character will thus not normally be
    considered equal to the same glyph represented by a single base character.
    For string comparison, the results depend on the collation mechanism of the
    locale, which might or might not respect such relations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Processing of multibyte character encodings is often notably
    slower than that of singlebyte character encodings. Since many widely-used
    languages (especially European ones based on Latin letters) contain few
    multibyte characters if encoded in UTF-8, and since experience shows that
    large amounts of textual data tend to be machine generated and to contain
    mostly ASCII characters (e.g. log files), while international language texts
    are mostly created by humans and tend to be smaller, processing of text in
    multibyte locales has generally been optimized for ASCII text. The
    performance penalty for using a multibyte locale is thus usually low if no
    or few multibyte characters actually occur in the data processed.</p>
<p class="Pp">A problem with multibyte encodings that does not normally occur in
    singlebyte encodings is that of illegal byte sequences. In a singlebyte
    locale, each byte is treated as a character entity even if its value is not
    defined in the coded character set. For example, bytes with their highest
    bit set are simply passed through in the default `C' or `POSIX' locale, and
    can appear in option arguments as well as in input data. In multibyte
    locales however, byte sequences that do not form a valid character cannot be
    handled this way, because it is not always clear which bytes are to be
    grouped together. As an example, suppose that the `\200' byte introduces a
    multibyte sequence. If this byte occurs in a string to be matched by a
    utility but is not followed by a valid continuation byte, it is unclear if
    it should match any byte sequence containing this byte, including valid ones
    that form a character, or if matches should be restricted to occurences in
    other incomplete sequences. For this reason, this implementation generally
    treats illegal byte sequences in command line arguments or programming
    scripts as syntax errors. Utilities do not issue a warning or even terminate
    with an error if such sequences appear in input data, though, since this
    frequently occurs in practice when processing binary or foreign-locale
    files. In most cases, the sequences are passed to the output unaltered. That
    data is accepted or generated by a utility can thus not be taken as an
    indication for its validity in respect to the current character
  encoding.</p>
