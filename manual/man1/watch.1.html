<p class="Pp">The <b>watch</b> utility executes a command repeatedly every
    &quot;user-defined&quot; seconds. This allows you to watch a program output
    change over the time.</p>
<p class="Pp">It accepts the following options:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><b>-n</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the interval to refresh the output. Per default, the interval is
      of 2 seconds.</dd>
  <dt id="b"><a class="permalink" href="#b"><b>-b</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Beeps if the program being run returns a non-zero exit status.</dd>
  <dt id="t"><a class="permalink" href="#t"><b>-t</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Turns off the information header, letting just the verbatim program output
      being refreshed every time on the screen &#x2014; equivalent to a
      <i>ksh</i>(1) <i>for ((;;))</i> accompanied by <i>sleep</i>(1).
    <br/>
    Not recommended, unless you're using <i>tmux</i>(1) or another terminal
      multiplexer that shows you information that would originally be shown by
      that header.</dd>

<p class="Pp">It can be very useful when backuping some disc and needing to see
    how many files were already copied.
  <br/>
  Lets suppose you're copying a disc from a terminal and, in another, you want
    to keep an eye at <i>du</i>(1) output to see every minute if the file size
    matches with what you're expecting.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <b>watch(1)</b> utility has a hazy history. Nobody seems to be
    actually sure of where it has appeared first.
  <br/>
  According to procps 010114's watch C source code, where it first appeared in
    that package, it was written from scratch by Tony Rems in 1991, and later
    recieved many modifications and corrections by Francois Pinard.
  <br/>
  However, according to Internet Initiative Japan Inc.'s iwatch manual page, the
    watch utility came first from BSDI Inc. BSD/OS 3.1 and their code is
    slightly derived from it; he/she &#x2014; who wrote the manual page and
    comments at the original source code &#x2014; also speculated that its
    existence was earlier than BSD/OS 3.1, from some another free distribution,
    but there's no further information that supports this.</p>
<p class="Pp">This implementation mimicks some of the basic behavior of
    procps-ng's watch, just the necessary to have a useful, simple and stable
    program.</p>
