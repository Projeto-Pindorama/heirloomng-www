<i>Col</i> reads the standard input and writes the standard output. It performs
  the line overlays implied by reverse line feeds (ESC-7 in ASCII) and by
  forward and reverse half line feeds (ESC-9 and ESC-8). <i>Col</i> is
  particularly useful for filtering multicolumn output made with the `.rt'
  command of <i>nroff</i> and output resulting from use of the <i>tbl</i>(1)
  preprocessor.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although <i>col</i> accepts half line motions in its input, it normally does not
  emit them on output. Instead, text that would appear between lines is moved to
  the next lower full line boundary. This treatment can be suppressed by the
  <b>-f</b> (fine) option; in this case the output from <i>col</i> may contain
  forward half line feeds (ESC-9), but will still never contain either kind of
  reverse line motion.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-b</b> option is given, <i>col</i> assumes that the output device in
  use is not capable of backspacing. In this case, if several characters are to
  appear in the same place, only the last one read will be taken.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The control characters SO (ASCII code 017), and SI (016) are assumed to start
  and end text in an alternate character set. The character set (primary or
  alternate) associated with each printing character read is remembered; on
  output, SO and SI characters are generated where necessary to maintain the
  correct treatment of each character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Col</i> normally converts white space to tabs to shorten printing time. If
  the <b>-x</b> option is given, this conversion is suppressed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All control characters are removed from the input except space, backspace, tab,
  return, newline, ESC (033) followed by one of 7, 8, 9, SI, SO, and VT (013).
  This last character is an alternate form of full reverse line feed, for
  compatibility with some other hardware conventions. With the <b>-p</b> option,
  all escape sequences are passed through, but <i>col</i> does not perform any
  interpretation of sequences unknown to it so its output may not be appropriate
  with this option. All other non-printing characters are ignored.
