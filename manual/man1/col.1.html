<p class="Pp"><i>Col</i> reads the standard input and writes the standard
    output. It performs the line overlays implied by reverse line feeds (ESC-7
    in ASCII) and by forward and reverse half line feeds (ESC-9 and ESC-8).
    <i>Col</i> is particularly useful for filtering multicolumn output made with
    the `.rt' command of <i>nroff</i> and output resulting from use of the
    <i>tbl</i>(1) preprocessor.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although <i>col</i> accepts half line motions in its input, it
    normally does not emit them on output. Instead, text that would appear
    between lines is moved to the next lower full line boundary. This treatment
    can be suppressed by the <b>-f</b> (fine) option; in this case the output
    from <i>col</i> may contain forward half line feeds (ESC-9), but will still
    never contain either kind of reverse line motion.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-b</b> option is given, <i>col</i> assumes that the
    output device in use is not capable of backspacing. In this case, if several
    characters are to appear in the same place, only the last one read will be
    taken.</p>
<p class="Pp">The control characters SO (ASCII code 017), and SI (016) are
    assumed to start and end text in an alternate character set. The character
    set (primary or alternate) associated with each printing character read is
    remembered; on output, SO and SI characters are generated where necessary to
    maintain the correct treatment of each character.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Col</i> normally converts white space to tabs to shorten
    printing time. If the <b>-x</b> option is given, this conversion is
    suppressed.</p>
<p class="Pp">All control characters are removed from the input except space,
    backspace, tab, return, newline, ESC (033) followed by one of 7, 8, 9, SI,
    SO, and VT (013). This last character is an alternate form of full reverse
    line feed, for compatibility with some other hardware conventions. With the
    <b>-p</b> option, all escape sequences are passed through, but <i>col</i>
    does not perform any interpretation of sequences unknown to it so its output
    may not be appropriate with this option. All other non-printing characters
    are ignored.</p>
