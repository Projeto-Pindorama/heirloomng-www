<i>Ed</i> is the standard text editor.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a <i>name</i> argument is given, <i>ed</i> simulates an <i>e</i> command (see
  below) on the named file; that is to say, the file is read into <i>ed</i>'s
  buffer so that it can be edited. The optional <b>-</b> or <b>-s</b> suppresses
  the printing of character counts by <i>e</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>w</i> commands,
  and of the `!' after completion of a shell command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the <b>-p</b> option, the given <i>prompt</i> string is printed before each
  command is read.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Ed</i> operates on a copy of any file it is editing; changes made in the copy
  have no effect on the file until a <i>w</i> (write) command is given. The copy
  of the text being edited resides in a temporary file called the <i>buffer</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The editor supports format specifications as defined in <i>fspec</i>(5). If the
  terminal is configured to expand tabulators (as enabled with <i>stty tab3</i>
  or <i>stty -tabs</i>), and the first line of the file being edited contains a
  format specification, the <i>t</i> and <i>s</i> are interpreted, that is,
  tabulators are expanded and lines are truncated when printing to the terminal.
  For example,
<div class="Bd-indent">&lt;:t-f s72:&gt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
</div>
selects FORTRAN format and truncates lines at 72 characters. No expansion or
  truncation is performed by <i>ed</i> when input is typed to the terminal.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Commands to <i>ed</i> have a simple and regular structure: zero or more
  <i>addresses</i> followed by a single character <i>command,</i> possibly
  followed by parameters to the command. These addresses specify one or more
  lines in the buffer. Missing addresses are supplied by default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general, only one command may appear on a line. Certain commands allow the
  addition of text to the buffer. While <i>ed</i> is accepting text, it is said
  to be in <i>input mode.</i> In this mode, no commands are recognized; all
  input is merely collected. Input mode is left by typing a period ` <b>.</b>'
  alone at the beginning of a line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Ed</i> supports a limited form of <i>regular expression</i> notation. A
  regular expression specifies a set of strings of characters. A member of this
  set of strings is said to be <i>matched</i> by the regular expression. In the
  following specification for regular expressions the word `character' means any
  character but newline. <b>/usr/5bin/ed</b> uses simple regular expressions,
  whereas <b>/usr/5bin/s42/ed</b>, <b>/usr/5bin/posix/ed</b>, and
  <b>/usr/5bin/posix2001/ed</b> use basic regular expressions.

      collating weight as <i>c</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Regular expressions are used in addresses to specify lines and in one command
  (see <i>s</i> below) to specify a portion of a line which is to be replaced.
  If it is desired to use one of the regular expression metacharacters as an
  ordinary character, that character may be preceded by `\'. This also applies
  to the character bounding the regular expression (often `/') and to `\'
  itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To understand addressing in <i>ed</i> it is necessary to know that at any time
  there is a <i>current line.</i> Generally speaking, the current line is the
  last line affected by a command; however, the exact effect on the current line
  is discussed under the description of the command. Addresses are constructed
  as follows.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>The character `<b>.</b>' addresses the current line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>The character `<b>$</b>' addresses the last line of the buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>A decimal number <i>n</i> addresses the <i>n</i>-th line of the
    buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>`<b>&#x2032;</b><i>x</i>' addresses the line marked with the name
      <i>x</i>, which must be a lower-case letter. Lines are marked with the
      <i>k</i> command described below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>5.</dt>
  <dd>A regular expression enclosed in slashes `<b>/</b>' addresses the line
      found by searching forward from the current line and stopping at the first
      line containing a string that matches the regular expression. If necessary
      the search wraps around to the beginning of the buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>6.</dt>
  <dd>A regular expression enclosed in queries `<b>?</b>' addresses the line
      found by searching backward from the current line and stopping at the
      first line containing a string that matches the regular expression. If
      necessary the search wraps around to the end of the buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>7.</dt>
  <dd>An address followed by a plus sign `<b>+</b>' or a minus sign ` <b>-</b>'
      followed by a decimal number specifies that address plus (resp. minus) the
      indicated number of lines. The plus sign may be omitted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>8.</dt>
  <dd>If an address begins with `<b>+</b>' or `<b>-</b>' the addition or
      subtraction is taken with respect to the current line; e.g. `-5' is
      understood to mean ` <b>.</b>-5'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>9.</dt>
  <dd>If an address ends with `<b>+</b>' or `<b>-</b>', then 1 is added (resp.
      subtracted). As a consequence of this rule and rule 8, the address `-'
      refers to the line before the current line. Moreover, trailing `+' and `-'
      characters have cumulative effect, so `--' refers to the current line less
      2.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>10.</dt>
  <dd>To maintain compatibility with earlier versions of the editor, the
      character ` <b>^</b>' in addresses is equivalent to `-'.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Commands may require zero, one, or two addresses. Commands which require no
  addresses regard the presence of an address as an error. Commands which accept
  one or two addresses assume default addresses when insufficient are given. If
  more addresses are given than such a command requires, the last one or two
  (depending on what is accepted) are used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Addresses are separated from each other typically by a comma ` <b>,</b>'. They
  may also be separated by a semicolon ` <b>;</b>'. In this case the current
  line ` <b>.</b>' is set to the previous address before the next address is
  interpreted. This feature can be used to determine the starting line for
  forward and backward searches (`/', `?'). The second address of any
  two-address sequence must correspond to a line following the line
  corresponding to the first address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Omission of the first address causes the first line to be used with `,', or the
  current line with `;', respectively; if the second address is also omitted,
  the last line of the buffer is used. Thus a single `,' specifies the entire
  contents of the buffer, and a single `;' specifies the contents ranging from
  the current line to the last one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the following list of <i>ed</i> commands, the default addresses are shown in
  parentheses. The parentheses are not part of the address, but are used to show
  that the given addresses are the default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As mentioned, it is generally illegal for more than one command to appear on a
  line. However, most commands may be suffixed by `p', `l', or `n', in which
  case the current line is either printed, listed, or numbered respectively in
  the way discussed below.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(<i>.</i>)<b>a</b></dt>

    The append command reads the given text and appends it after the addressed
      line. ` <b>.</b>' is left on the last line input, if there were any,
      otherwise at the addressed line. Address `0' is legal for this command;
      text is placed at the beginning of the buffer.</dd>

    The change command deletes the addressed lines, then accepts input text
      which replaces these lines. ` <b>.</b>' is left at the last line input; if
      there were none, it is left at the line preceding the deleted lines. For
      <b>/usr/5bin/posix2001/ed</b>, a `0' as the first address is identical to
      `1'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(<i>.</i><b>,</b><i>.</i>)<b>d</b></dt>
  <dd>The delete command deletes the addressed lines from the buffer. The line
      originally after the last line deleted becomes the current line; if the
      lines deleted were originally at the end, the new last line becomes the
      current line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>The edit command causes the entire contents of the buffer to be deleted,
      and then the named file to be read in. ` <b>.</b>' is set to the last line
      of the buffer. The number of characters read is typed. ` <i>filename</i>'
      is remembered for possible use as a default file name in a subsequent
      <i>r</i> or <i>w</i> command. If ` <i>filename</i>' is missing, the
      remembered name is used. A ` <i>filename</i>' starting with a `<b>!</b>'

      in.</dd>

      line. A single command or the first of multiple commands appears on the
      same line with the global command. All lines of a multi-line list except
      the last line must be ended with `\'. <i>A,</i> <i>i,</i> and <i>c</i>
      commands and associated input are permitted; the ` <b>.</b>' terminating

  <dd>The substitute command searches each addressed line for an occurrence of
      the specified regular expression. On each line in which a match is found,
      all matched strings are replaced by the replacement specified, if the
      global replacement indicator `<b>g</b>' appears after the command. If the
      global indicator does not appear, only the first occurrence of the matched
      string is replaced; if the <i>number</i> indicator is given, the numbered
      occurrence is replaced. It is an error for the substitution to fail on all
      addressed lines. Any character other than space or new-line may be used
      instead of `/' to delimit the regular expression and the replacement. `
      <b>.</b>' is left at the last line substituted.</dd>

      the text matched by the <i>n</i>-th regular subexpression enclosed between

    The write command writes the addressed lines onto the given file. If the
      file does not exist, it is created mode 666 (readable and writable by
      everyone). The file name is remembered if there was no remembered file
      name already. If no file name is given, the remembered file name, if any,
      is used (see <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> commands). ` <b>.</b>' is unchanged. If
      the command is successful, the number of characters written is printed. A
      `filename' starting with a ` <b>!</b>' causes the string following this
      character to be executed as a shell command with the addressed lines as
      standard input.</dd>

The following commands are extensions:
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Prints a screenful of lines, starting at the addressed one, and browses
      forward in the buffer by this amount. With the optional <i>count</i>
      argument, the screen size for this and following <i>b</i> commands is set
      to the given number of lines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>help</b></dt>
  <dd>Causes a summary of <i>ed</i> commands along with short descriptions to be

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Makes the <i>p</i> command behave like the <i>n</i> command and

    restored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(<i>.</i>)<b>o</b>[<i>count</i>]</dt>
  <dd>Prints a screenful of lines centered around the addressed one. The current
      line is not changed. With the optional <i>count</i> argument, the amount
      of lines printed above and below for this and following <i>o</i> commands
      is set to the given number.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

If an interrupt signal is sent, <i>ed</i> prints a `?' and returns to its
  command level.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An input line that consists exactly of the two characters `\.' causes a period
  `.' to be inserted with the <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>i</i> commands in
  <b>/usr/5bin/ed</b> and <b>/usr/5bin/s42/ed</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some size limitations: The maximum number of bytes in the buffer corresponds to
  the address size; on machines with 32-bit addressing, it is 2&#x00A0;G bytes,
  with 64-bit addressing, it is 9&#x00A0;E bytes. The limit on the number of
  lines depends on the amount of core: each line takes 2 words.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a line contains a NUL character, regular expressions cannot match beyond this
  character. A substitute command deletes a NUL and all following characters on
  the line. NUL characters in command input are discarded. If an input file does
  not end with a newline, <i>ed</i> prints a message and appends one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Omission of the `/' character following the regular expression or the
  replacement string to the global and substitute commands causes the affected
  lines to be printed. Thus the following commands have the same effect:
<div class="Bd-indent">g/pattern	g/pattern/p
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
s/pattern/repl	s/pattern/repl/p
<div>&#x00A0;</div>

To protect against throwing away valuable work, a <i>q</i> or <i>e</i> command
  is considered to be in error, unless a <i>w</i> has occurred since the last

The LC_COLLATE variable has currently no effect. Ranges in bracket expressions
  are ordered as byte values in single-byte locales and as wide character values
  in multibyte locales; equivalence classes match the given character only, and
  multi-character collating elements are not available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For portable programs, restrict textual data to the US-ASCII character set, set
  the LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE variables to `C' or `POSIX', and use the
  constructs in the second column instead of the character class expressions as
  follows:
