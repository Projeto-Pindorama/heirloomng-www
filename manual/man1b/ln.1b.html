A link is a directory entry referring to a file; the same file (together with
  its size, all its protection information, etc.) may have several links to it.
  There are two kinds of links: hard links and symbolic links.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default <i>ln</i> makes hard links. A hard link to a file is
  indistinguishable from the original directory entry; any changes to a file are
  effective independent of the name used to reference the file. Hard links may
  not span file systems and may not refer to directories.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-s</b> option causes <i>ln</i> to create symbolic links. A symbolic link
  contains the name of the file to which it is linked. The referenced file is
  used when an <i>open</i>(2) operation is performed on the link. A
  <i>stat</i>(2) on a symbolic link will return the linked-to file; an
  <i>lstat</i>(2) must be done to obtain information about the link. The
  <i>readlink</i>(2) call may be used to read the contents of a symbolic link.
  Symbolic links may span file systems and may refer to directories.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Given one or two arguments, <i>ln</i> creates a link to an existing file
  <i>sourcename</i>. If <i>targetname</i> is given, the link has that name;
  <i>targetname</i> may also be a directory in which to place the link;
  otherwise it is placed in the current directory. If only the directory is
  specified, the link will be made to the last component of <i>sourcename</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Given more than two arguments, <i>ln</i> makes links in <i>targetdirectory</i>
  to all the named source files. The links made will have the same name as the
  files being linked to.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-f</b> option is present, <i>ln</i> tries to create hard links to
  directories.
