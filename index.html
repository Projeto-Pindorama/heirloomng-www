	<h2 id="what">What is it?</h2>
        <p>Heirloom NG is a collection of standard UNIX® utilities that is
        intended to provide maximum compatibility with traditional UNIX® while
        incorporating additional features necessary today.<br/>
        It's mostly written from scratch, along with some tools that were
        released under open source licences by <a
        href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/UNIX/">Caldera International Inc.</a>
        and <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091212202000/http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Main/">
        Sun Microsystems</a>.<br/>
        It <b>provides many UNIX® utilities</b>, with some having variants for
        compatibility with various specifications &mdash; to be specific,
        SVID3/SVR4, SVID4/SVR4.2MP, POSIX.2-1992/SUSV2, POSIX.1-2001/SUSV3,
        and BSD (a.k.a. SVR4's <tt>/usr/ucb</tt>).</p>
        <h2 id="differences">What are the differences from the last release of
        Heirloom Toolchest?</h2>
        <p>The last release of the original Heirloom Toolchest project was made
        in July 15th of 2007. Since then, many things have changed, such as
        UNIX®-compatible systems ABIs having dropped legacy functions and data
        structures that were inherited from workarounds/bad practices present
        in older systems.<br/>Although trying to maintain compatibility with
        environments that the pre-fork releases already supported, <b>Heirloom
        NG also ported the code to work with newer systems and standard C
        libraries</b>.<br/>
        Another change was the finality: while the old Heirloom Toolchest was
        aimed just to "caters to people who like to operate their computers
        using a traditional Unix command line interface", <b>Heirloom NG arose
        from the need of a complete alternative to existent toolsets</b>, along
        with the idea of also having a traditional and stone-cold environment,
        so <b>new tools, such as <a href="./manual/man8/chroot.8.html">
        <tt>chroot</tt>(8)</a> and <a href="./manual/man1/readlink.1.html">
        <tt>readlink</tt>(1)</a> were implemented</b>.<br/>
        In sum, Heirloom NG is the original Heirloom Toolchest, but
        <b>maintained and enhanced</b> with the idea of supplying a full
        UNIX®-compatible toolset.</p>

        <p>The lastest release is <span id="latest-tag"></span>.<br/> 
        You can use the command below retrieve a release copy from one of
        <a href="http://pindorama.dob.jp">Pindorama</a> project servers:
<pre>
    $ curl -SO# http://pindorama.dob.jp/pub/heirloom-ng/YYMMDD.tar.gz
</pre>
        <p>Or, if you prefer, you can also retrieve a copy both from the
        current development tree or a release directly from the git
        repository:</p>
<pre>
    $ git clone -b [YYMMDD|master] https://github.com/Projeto-Pindorama/heirloom-ng.git

        <p>This is a list of projects currently and/or planning to utilize
        Heirloom NG as an alternative or the as the default UNIX®-compatible
        tool set.<p>
        <li><a href="http://copacabana.pindorama.dob.jp">
        Copacabana Linux®</a> uses Heirloom NG per default;</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/dslm4515/CMLFS">Clang Musl-LFS</a>
        already has a placeholder for instructions regarding building
        Heirloom NG as an alternative to other toolsets;</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ryanwoodsmall/crosware">crosware</a>,
        which is a set of tools and "recipes" for building software on ChromeOS,
        includes Heirloom NG in the list of "recipes to consider".</li>
        <h2 id="chip-in">Chip in!</h2>
        <p>We can't make this happen all alone. There are many ways <u>you</u>
        can chip in. Testing for compatibility or bugs? Implementing the latest
        POSIX standard at the default variants of commands? Implementing lacking
        commands? There you go.<br/>
